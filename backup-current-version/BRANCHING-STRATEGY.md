# Color Shader - Git Branching Strategy

## 🎯 BRANCHING STRATEGY FOR SEO-SAFE DEVELOPMENT

### Branch Structure

```
main (production - GitHub Pages deployment)
├── develop (stable development - SEO optimized)
└── feature/development (active development)
    ├── feature/analytics (Google Analytics integration)
    ├── feature/blog (content section)
    ├── feature/accessibility (color accessibility checker)
    └── feature/export-formats (additional export options)
```

## 🚀 WORKFLOW PROCESS

### Current Status
- ✅ **main**: Production branch (deployed to GitHub Pages)
- ✅ **develop**: SEO-optimized stable version (DO NOT CHANGE)
- ✅ **feature/development**: Active development branch (WORK HERE)

### Development Workflow

#### 1. Daily Development (feature/development)
```bash
git checkout feature/development
# Make changes, add features, experiment
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin feature/development
```

#### 2. Feature Branches (for specific features)
```bash
git checkout feature/development
git checkout -b feature/analytics
# Develop specific feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add Google Analytics integration"
git push origin feature/analytics
```

#### 3. Merge to Development
```bash
git checkout feature/development
git merge feature/analytics
git push origin feature/development
```

#### 4. Strategic Updates (Monthly)
```bash
# Create PR: feature/development → develop
# Review changes carefully
# Merge only SEO-safe, tested features
```

#### 5. Production Deploy (When Ready)
```bash
# Create PR: develop → main
# Triggers GitHub Pages deployment
# Live website updates
```
